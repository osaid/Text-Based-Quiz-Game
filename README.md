# Text-Based-Quiz-Game
My first public project: a text-based quiz game in Python to apply core programming concepts such as loops, functions, error handling, and game logic.

## Description
This is a console-based quiz game written in Python. The game allows players to select a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) and answer a series of multiple-choice questions. Players earn points for correct answers and have limited "health" for wrong answers. Also, the game can be replayed multiple times.

## Current Features
- Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty levels
- 5 questions per game
- Tracks score and remaining health
- Option to play again after finishing a game

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/osaid/Text-Based-Quiz-Game`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd learningpython/pythoncrashcourse`
3. Make sure you have Python installed (>= 3.11 recommended)
4. Run the game: `python quiz_game.py`

## Usage
- Enter your answer (A, B, C, or D) when prompted.
- Type `Y` to play again or `N` to quit.

## Future Improvements
- Add more questions
- Store high scores
- Add timer for answering questions
- Implement categories for questions
